          <h1>Background</h1>
          <p>
            Local businesses are a major factor that drives today’s national 
            economy. In the United states, these businesses create more than 
            two-thirds of the total new jobs and according to a report published 
            by the Office of Advocacy for the U.S. small business administration, 
            they account for 44% of the nation’s economic activity. However 
            unlike large companies and corporations, these local businesses are 
            more prone to the effects of events such as COVID where the customer 
            base can decrease significantly. A solution that aims to bring 
            customers to shop at these businesses can stimulate the local 
            economies and reinvigorate the job market that has been affected.
          </p>
          <h1>What is CloudBerry?</p>
          <p>
            CloudBerry is a platform that aims to support local businesses, 
            especially during these times with COVID-19. We provide a space where
            local business owner can catalog their items, and customers can go
            out and search for product from these bsuiness to buy.
          </p>
          <h1>How it works</h1>
          <p>
            Cloudberry is powered by Google's Vision AI platform. Using various
            computer vision techniques from optical text recognition, image 
            labelling, object identification, and image product search, 
            CloudBerry allows business owners to seamlessly catalog product with 
            little hastle and customers to search for the products using pictures.
            On the business side, Cloudberry uses cloud vision to automatically
            label and categorize products from the images that business owners 
            upload. This aims to cut down on cataloging time and also provides 
            a general standard when comparing products from various different
            businesses to each other. On the customer side, CloudBerry uses 
            google cloud's trained machine learning algorithms to be able to 
            search for similar products with just a picture.
